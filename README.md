## Description 
This is my first project exam at Noroff. This project involves creating a web presence for the Community Science Museum, an interactive science museum opening soon in our area. The museum targets primary and middle school children (ages 7-15) and families with young children.

+ **Requirements:**
  + Use the provided image and text content
  + Design a placeholder logo, as the final logo is not yet decided
  + Ensure the website is modern, accessible, and responsive

The goal is to create a site that attracts and engages visitors, encouraging them to explore the museum.
